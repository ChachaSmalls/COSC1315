A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales.
Write a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, and then
displays the profit that will be made from that amount.
Hint: Use the value 0.23 to represent 23 percent

    #ask the user to enter projected amount of total sales
